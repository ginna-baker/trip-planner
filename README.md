trip-planner
============

One-page Express application allows the user to plan a trip to New York City including adding venue markers to a map, shifting between Days, and saving each trip to the back end using MongoDB.  Uses google maps JavaScript API v3 and a JSON seed database for venue addresses.  Could easily be scaled to work in other cities given that city's seed data.
